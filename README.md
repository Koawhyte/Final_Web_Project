This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my skills and experience. The website currently consists of:

- Home/Index page with an about section
- Contact page, making it easy for visitors to get in touch
- Services page, outlining my offerings

*Features*

- Input field validation using JavaScript for enhanced user experience
- Separate pages for contact and services

*Deployment*

You can view the live site here: [https://final-web-project-beryl.vercel.app]

*Technologies Used*

- HTML5 for structuring and organizing content
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic effects

*Development Process*

During development, I utilized JavaScript to implement input field validation, ensuring that the form functions correctly and provides a seamless user experience. I tested the website locally before deploying it online, using Git for version control. The website was deployed using vercel.

*Challenges and Solutions*

One of the challenges I faced was implementing robust input field validation using JavaScript. To overcome this, I researched and implemented a custom validation script that meets the requirements of the website.

*Future Improvements*

If I were to continue working on this project, I might consider adding more features, such as:

- A separate About page with sections on:
    - My Experiences: highlighting my relevant work experience and skills
    - Projects: showcasing specific projects I've worked on, with descriptions and details
- A blog section to share my thoughts and experiences
- A more complex form validation system
- Integration with a content management system (CMS) for easier updates
